            <h3>Journey</h3>
            <p>
                In my professional journey spanning over 10 years, I have gained extensive experience in the oil and gas industry. Throughout my career, I have been involved in various projects, working in different locations beyond Sarawak, including Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and South Korea. One of my most valuable experiences was during my attachment in South Korea, where I worked alongside a diverse team on a significant project that was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, marking the launch of 'Sail Away.' This opportunity not only enriched my professional skills but also allowed me to appreciate multicultural collaboration in a dynamic work environment.

            <p>
                As an adventuress, I thrive on the thrill of adventure activities that push my limits and allow me to connect with nature. One of my most exhilarating experiences was white-water rafting in the Padas River in Kota Kinabalu. The rush of navigating the swift currents, surrounded by the stunning natural beauty of the Malaysian rainforest, was an unforgettable experience.
                The energy of the rapids and the teamwork required to maneuver through the twists and turns of the river made the experience both challenging and rewarding. Every splash of water and roar of the river filled me with excitement and adrenaline. It was not just about the activity itself but also the camaraderie formed with fellow rafters as we cheered each other on and celebrated our triumphs over the challenging sections of the river.
                This adventure reinforced my love for outdoor activities and my desire to seek out similar thrilling experiences. As an adventuress, I embrace every opportunity to explore new environments and engage in activities that challenge and inspire me, continually fueling my passion for adventure.            </p>

            <p>
                As a woman with wanderlust, my passion for travel drives me to explore diverse cultures and breathtaking landscapes around the globe. I’ve had the incredible opportunity to visit various ASEAN countries, immersing myself in the vibrant traditions and lifestyles of places like Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea. Each journey has deepened my appreciation for different cuisines, customs, and the warmth of the local people.
                My travels have also taken me to Europe, where I explored iconic cities such as Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. Paris enchanted me with its romantic atmosphere and artistic heritage, while Brussels offered a fascinating blend of history and modern charm. In Amsterdam, I enjoyed wandering along picturesque canals and visiting world-class museums. In the United Kingdom, I discovered the rich cultural scenes of London, Manchester, and Liverpool, which showcased the country’s musical and historical significance.
                Traveling has shaped my understanding of the world, filling my heart with cherished memories and inspiring stories. Each destination leaves a lasting impression, motivating me to seek out new adventures and continue embracing the magic that different cultures and landscapes offer. My wanderlust fuels my desire to discover and share these experiences, encouraging others to embark on their own journeys of exploration.            </p>
